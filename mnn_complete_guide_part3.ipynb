    "## Definition  \n",
    "Define the following family of Dawson-like functions  \n",
    "$g(x)=e^{x^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{-u^2}du$  \n",
    "$h(x)=e^{x^2}\\int_{-\\infty}^x e^{-u^2}[g(u)]^2du$  \n",
    "$G(x)=\\int_0^x g(u)du$  \n",

    "## Motivation\n",
    "In Moment Neural Network (MNN), the mean and the variance of the inter-spike-intervals (ISI) are defined through above integrals as follows  \n",
    "$\\mathbb{E}[T]\\propto \\int_a^b g(t)dt$,  \n",
    "and  \n",
    "${\\rm Var}[T]\\propto \\int_a^b h(t)dt$.  \n",
    "The evaluation of these integrals become extremely problematic for two reasons:  \n",
    "- Reliability: for $x<-1$, direct numerical evaluation of $g(x)$ and $h(x)$ using the definition encounters '$\\infty\\cdot0$' type numeric instability, even for moderately large value of $|x|$. This scenario is frequently encountered as negative values of $x$ happen to be in the biological range.  \n",
    "- Speed: direct evaluation of the mean and variance of ISI involves double or triple integrals that are costly to compute. A temporary workaround is to interpolate with a pre-calculated lookup table, however, the range and precision of this method is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues severely hinder the ability to scale up MNN and future research aimed at using MNN to perform deep learning.\n"

    "## Overview of the numerical scheme\n",
    "To resolve these issues, we employ a combination of techniques to approximate the Dawson functions. The overall strategy of the numeric scheme is to break the domain of these functions into four regions:  \n",

    "- ii. Intermediate negative values  $B=(-c,0]$   \n",
